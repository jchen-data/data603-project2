# data603-project2
Code for neural network project. Due to computation time, especially with the MNIST dataset, I was mostly limited to fairly basic architectures.

Manifest:
1) initialize.mlx: Code for generating mnist.mat from the raw MNIST dataset
2) pose_pr2.mlx: Code for training and testing neural network architectures on pose dataset
3) main_pr2.mlx: Code for training and testing neural network architectures on MNIST dataset
4) MNIST1-6.mat: mat files containing trained neural networks and training statistics, including parameters and accuracy on training and test set
